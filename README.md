# Sitemap Search

## Quickstart

```sh
# Build and start the container
docker compose up -d
```

### Add the static assets

During the first time install, your `app/static/assets` directory will be empty.

As you mount the project directory to the `/app` volume, the static assets from TNA Frontend installed inside the container will be "overwritten" by your empty directory.

To add back in the static assets, run:

```sh
docker compose exec app cp -r /app/node_modules/@nationalarchives/frontend/nationalarchives/assets /app/app/static
```

### Population

```sh
# Populate all pages from sitemaps and update existing entries
docker compose exec app poetry run python populate.py

# Process a specific sitemap
docker compose exec app poetry run python populate.py https://blog.nationalarchives.gov.uk/sitemap.xml

# Add new URLs but don't update existing ones
docker compose exec app poetry run python add_new.py

# Add new URLs from a specific sitemap
docker compose exec app poetry run python add_new.py https://blog.nationalarchives.gov.uk/sitemap.xml

# Fix URLs with remapped domains (e.g. website.live.local)
docker compose exec app poetry run python fix_remapped_domains.py

# Drop all URLs and re-index - THIS IS A DESTRUCTIVE ACTION
docker compose exec app poetry run python clean.py
```

### Run tests

```sh
docker compose exec dev poetry run python -m pytest
```

### Format and lint code

```sh
docker compose exec dev format
```
